I'm a cybersecurity researcher with a focus on embedded systems, hardware security, and satellite communication protocols. My experience includes:

- Former Embedded Systems Security Analyst at CESR Labs

- Ongoing Satellite Security Researcher at CEROC  
- Current Vulnerability Research Intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory  

I hold **CompTIA Security+** and **CompTIA CySA+** certifications and am proud to be a **Scholarship for Service (SFS) Scholar**.  

My academic timeline includes:
