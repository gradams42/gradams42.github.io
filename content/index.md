# About Me
I'm a cybersecurity researcher with a focus on embedded systems, hardware security, and satellite communication protocols. My experience includes:

- Vulnerability Research Intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory 
- Embedded Systems Security Analyst at CESR Labs  
- IT Security Intern at Rebo Electronics  
- Satellite Security Researcher at CEROC  


I hold **CompTIA Security+** and **CompTIA CySA+** certifications and am proud to be a **Scholarship for Service (SFS) Scholar**.  

My academic timeline includes:  
- **B.S. Computer Engineering** (expected December 2025)  
- **M.S. Cybersecurity** (expected December 2026)  

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring hardware security challenges and pushing the boundaries of satellite system protection within academia.
